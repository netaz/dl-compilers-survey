Resources on the application of Machine Learning for the optimization of DL compilers.

* [Awesome machine learning for compilers and program optimisation (github)](https://github.com/zwang4/awesome-machine-learning-in-compilers)
  > A curated list of awesome research papers, datasets, and tools for applying machine learning techniques to compilers and program optimisation.
* [AI Powered Compiler Techniques for DL Code Optimization (arxiv)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.05573)
  >  In this paper, we present machine learning powered compiler techniques to optimize loop nests.
* [Deep Learning Based Compiler Optimizations (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyXDgyQr1A0)
  > In this talk we will highlight some of the recent work that apply DL techniques to compiler heuristics and optimizations like vectorization and register allocation as well as End2end analyses of programs for predicting certain program characteristics. We will also talk about some of the challenges of using DL for compiler optimizations.
